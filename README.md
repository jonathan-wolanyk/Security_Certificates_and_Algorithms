# Software Security Portfolio Submission

<h3>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</h3>
Artemis Financial is a financial software consulting company that provides its patrons with individualized financial plans. The company is hoping to modernize its operations by upgrading its software security. Artemis Financial’s platform operates on a public web interface and hopes to implement changes further to protect its client’s data and financial information.
<h3>What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?</h3>
Working through the vulnerability assessment for Artemis Financial was thorough and helpful in identifying potential security flaws in the proposed program. By systematically evaluating each element of the vulnerability matrix, many errors that could be overlooked were accounted for. 
<h3>How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?</h3>
To increase the layers of security, I worked on implementing an algorithm cipher to encrypt and decrypt information that was sent to and requested from the server. Additionally, I utilized self-signed certificates to ensure the HTTPS protocol was properly enabled for the program.
<h3>How did you ensure the code and software application was functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</h3>
I utilized Maven dependency checks throughout the development of the program to ensure it was functional and secure. To check whether my refactored code introduced new vulnerabilities, I would complete dependency checks after each new update to the code base.
<h3>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work you have completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?</h3>
For future employers, I would showcase my ability to create and utilize self-signed certificates for testing purposes. Additionally, I would speak on my ability to implement algorithm ciphers to securely send and access information.
